# Pass Volt
Password management GUI made with Python's tkinter module.


It's main purpose is to make remembering unique complex passwords for your multiple accounts easier. 


Pass Volt stores all acount information into a local dbm file on your device using Python's shelve module.


This shold be a secure solution as long as you do not share the dbm file to other people or get your device stolen. :)


Current Features:

  *Login page so only you can access the data. Input fields characters are also hidden to protect your account from prying eyes. :)
  
  *Input validation for entry fields. Also, if new user, automatically creates account based on first input.  
  
  *Create new platform accounts that will be stored in the dbm file.
  
  *Delete existing accounts that will be removed from the dbm file.
  
  *Using the pyperclip module, automatically copies the password to the clipboard.
  
  
Work in progress:

  *GUI design and formatting
  
  COMPLETED on 26/1/2020 ~~*Create Pass Volt password page if new user.~~
